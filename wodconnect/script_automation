#An example of how to automate the script as a cron job on macOS or Linux:

#1. Open terminal
#2. Type "crontab -e" and press enter
#3. In the text editor type "i" to open "-- INSERT --" view
#4. Copy & paste on the top row of the editor: 
#5. "0 17 * * 2 sleep 10; /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 /Users/user/wodconnect.py"
#6. Press esc
#7. Type ":wq" and press enter (write & quit)

#'0' = minutes on the clock, '17' = hours on the clock, 2 = day of the week (tuesday) 'sleep 10' = the script waits 10 seconds before it runs

#Note that your computer has to be fully awake for python selenium to function as a cron job (eg. not in sleep mode)
